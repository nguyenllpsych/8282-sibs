### Research descriptions

In the current study, we aim to compare patterns of personality change between adoptive and non-adoptive sibling pairs. Despite differences in trait scores at a particular timepoint, there may be substantial overlap between developmental trajectories over time; such relationship could only be uncovered in a longitudinal repeated-measure design. We propose to expand the literature in several ways, including: the extended age span averaging from 15 to 32 years old covering emerging adulthood, personality assessments beyond the Big Five, the inclusion of life events, and most importantly, the comparison between adoptive and non-adoptive sibling pairs.

We will use data from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study from the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research (McGue et al., 2007), which included 406 adopted sibling pairs and 208 biological sibling pairs. Personality traits are assessed by the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (Tellegen & Waller, 2008) with three variables of Aggression, Control, and Harm Avoidance. The life events measure includes (1) family-related, (2) independent non-family, and (3) non-independent non-family events (Billig et al., 1996). The Sibling Relationship Questionnaire (Furman & Buhrmester, 1985) and Parental Environment Questionnaire (Elkins et al., 1997) assess family and sibling relationship quality.
